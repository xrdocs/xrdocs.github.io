## Introduction

CiscoLive is back! Scheduled for June 12-16, 2022 in Las Vegas, this in-person and digital event will be unique opportunity to reconnect after a long break.  

The Service Provider track will cover most [xrdocs.io](https://xrdocs.io) topics of interest such:
- 5G - Service Provider Deployment Considerations 
- Converged SDN Transport Architecture 
- Private 5G Enablers, Use Cases and Implementation 
- Optical Networking and Optics 
- Network Programmability, Automation and Security
- And more…

This post will help you pick your sessions and build your agenda.  

If you cannot attend in-person, sessions will be recorded and material will be published on Cisco Live website. Meanwhile, Cisco Live [on-demand library](https://www.ciscolive.com/on-demand/on-demand-library.html#/) is accessible and available for free to explore recent global Cisco Live content.
